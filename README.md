# Vertex cover algorithms

Min vertex cover algorithms is a library created to compare different algorithms solving the min-vertex-cover problem. 
Implemented Algotihms are :
- IPL (integer programming)
- LP  (Linear problem)
- ARB-VC
- Kernel-VC
- Greedy-VC
- An Heuristic

##Requirements

project use c++ standards and glpk libraries for IPL and LP

##Install

Go into Release folder :
```
$ cd Release/
```
and type the following commands :
```
$ make clean
$ make
```
##Run

to run the application run :
```
$ ./Vertex-Cover
```
and then follow the instructions in the terminal.
