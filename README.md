# Vertex cover algorithms

Min vertex cover algorithms is a library created to compare different algorithms solving the min-vertex-cover problem. 
Implemented Algotihms are :
- IPL (integer programming)
- LP  (Linear problem)
- ARB-VC
- Kernel-VC
- Greedy-VC
- A Heuristic

##Requirements

project use c++ standards and glpk libraries for IPL and LP
